=== Preliminary Requirements

Before beginning this guide, you should perform the following preliminary steps:

1. Review the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html[Getting started tutorial].
2. Using the tutorial, get MySQL, Kill Bill and Kaui set up and running in Docker containers.
3. Set up a tenant configured with API key `bob` and API secret `lazar`.
4. Ensure that you have http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] installed. This is only to be able to run the setup steps and examples from this documentation. In practice, your application will use one of our https://killbill.github.io/slate/[client libraries]. If you are on Windows, we recommend that you use https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git Bash] to run the `cURL` commands.
