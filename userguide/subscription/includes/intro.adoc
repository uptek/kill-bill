Kill Bill, as a system, is composed of several components:

* The core billing platform itself, which is embedded in a web server and offers a REST api. When we refer to Kill Bill in the documentation, this is what we are referring to, unless explicitly specified
* KAUI, the Kill Bill Admin UI, which is a Rails mountable engine, and communicates with the core billing platform using the REST api
* A set of client libraries (Java, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, ...)

Let's consider some common web-based use cases for Kill Bill. Each of these cases combines Kill Bill with custom code to implement the specific business logic required. Kill Bill solves the billing problem but not the custom flow required around the billing platform. This must be handled by the custom code, which should support the following functions:

* Offer a way for customers to select a plan from the Kill Bill catalog, which would result in the creation of a subscription
* Offer a form for customers to enter their payment information, using a credit card or any other payment method. The flow will differ depending on the payment gateway and PCI compliance needs
* Offer a way for customers to review and change their subscriptions
* Offer a way for customers to review and change their payment methods

The first option is to create a custom web app, containing the application-specific business logic, that interacts with Kill Bill using the REST API.

The second option is to embed the application-specific code inside Kill Bill. In this case no separate app is required.

The final option would be to create a custom web app and embed Kill Bill into it. Kill Bill offers a set of Java APIs below the REST API, so it is possible to use Kill Bill as a billing library.
