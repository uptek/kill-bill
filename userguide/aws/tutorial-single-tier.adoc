= Tutorial: Single-Tier Option


== Introduction

In this tutorial you will set up a working environment on AWS with Kill Bill and Kaui using the *single-tier* option. Everything you need for this option is bundled in the Kill Bill Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and can be launched on a single virtual Linux system, which AWS calls an *EC2 instance*.

== Step 1: Login to AWS

To begin, log in to Amazon Web Services at https://aws.amazon.com. If you are new to AWS, you will be asked to create an account and provide billing information. You will need to sign in as a *Root User*. This should take you to the *AWS Management Console*, which provides links to all available services.

Check the upper right corner of your screen to be sure you are in the appropriate *region*. Your EC2 instance will be placed in this region, and may not be accessible from other regions.


== Step 2: Subscribe to the Kill Bill AMI

To start the installation process, point your browser to the Kill Bill AMI at

+++.

You should see the following image at the top of your screen:

Click *Continue to Subscribe*. The next page will give the AWS Terms and Conditions. Accept the terms if asked. You will then see a new message confirming that you have subscribed. Next, click *Continue to Configuration*.

== Step 3: Set Up EC2 Configuration

The next page will give several configuration options.

Be sure to select the correct region for your account. Accept the other defaults, and click *Continue to Launch*.

The next page will give you several options for the launch method. Choose *Launch through EC2*.

All other options will disappear. Click *Launch*.

== Step 4: Create a Key Pair

The next page is headed *Launch an Instance*. Scroll down to the middle of this page, to the box titled *Key Pair (login)* Here you are asked to choose or create a *key pair*.

We will create a new key pair. Click *Create Key Pair* to display a pane to be used for the creation. Give the key pair a simple, easy to remember name such as `My-Key-Pair`. Do not change the other options on this pane. Then click *Download Key Pair*. *Important:* You *must* save the private key that will be generated in this step. If you lose this key, you will *not* be able to login to your instance. In addition, you must set the protection for this file so it is readable by the owner only.

== Step 5: Launch Your Instance

When the key pair is generated, click *Launch Instances*. You should see the screen below:

Your instance is finally launching! To follow what is happening on the EC2 Dashboard, scroll all the way down to the bottom, and click *View all instances* at the bottom right. This will take you to the *Instances* screen which is part of the EC2 Dashboard.

In a short time, the *Instance State* for your instance should indicate *Running*. Select the checkbox to the left of your instance ID. An information pane should open below with details about your instance.

== Step 6: Testing

You can now try to login to Kaui from your browser using the URL `\https://INSTANCE_IP:443`, where INSTANCE_IP is the IPV4 address for your instance, given on your dashboard as *Public IPV4 Address*. If all goes well, this should display the Kaui login screen. The browser may complain that your connection is not secure, but it should offer you a way to bypass the problem.

For an introduction to Kaui, see our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_kaui.html[Kaui Guide]. The default credentials are: `admin` / `{EC2 instance ID}`. The first few requests might be a bit slow as Kill Bill initializes itself.

In addition, you can visit the Kill Bill server using the URL `\https://INSTANCE_IP:8443`. This provides access to certain detailed reports that may be needed for maintenance, including metrics, event logs, and the Swagger API pages.
