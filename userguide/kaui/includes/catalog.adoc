The Kill Bill catalog is stored in XML format. This section explains how to upload an XML file that contains the product catalog information.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You cannot edit a raw XML catalog in Kaui.

If you are replacing a catalog with a newer version, ensure that `<catalogName>` in the XML file is the same as the existing catalog. The catalog filename does not need to be the same.

[NOTE]
*Note:* To ensure a successful catalog file upload, check its validity with the https://cloud.killbill.io/tools/catalog[Kill Bill catalog validation tool].
