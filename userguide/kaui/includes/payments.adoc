This section helps you become familiar with the Payments and Payment Details pages.

For more information on payments, see:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_payment.html[_Payment Guide_]

=== Payments Page
The Payments page lists any payments applied to invoices for the customer account. This page also lists information about scheduled payment retries for failed payments.

To open the Payments page, open the account and select *Payments* on the sub-menu.

[NOTE]
*Note:* If a customer account has a default payment method, Kaui automatically makes a payment when an invoice is generated in the system. See <<about_automatic_invoice_payments, About Automatic Invoice Payments>> for more information.

=== About Automatic Invoice Payments

Kill Bill automatically generates a payment for an invoice if an account:

* Has an outstanding, unpaid invoice
AND
* Has a default and valid payment method

Kill Bill _does not_ automatically generate an invoice payment if:

* No default payment method exists for the account
* The default payment method is invalid (e.g., expired credit card)
* The `AUTO_PAY_OFF` or `MANUAL_PAY` https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-tag[system tags] are defined for the account

[NOTE]
*Note:* For invoices that Kill Bill does not automatically pay, you can use the "Pay all Invoices" feature. For more information, see <<pay_all_unpaid_invoices, Pay All Unpaid Invoices>>.

=== Payment Details Page

The Payment Details page displays information about a specific payment, such as the date it was generated,
amount, and so forth. Below the payment information is information about the payment method used.

On the Payment Details page, you can: <<refund_a_payment, refund a payment>> or <<Perform a Chargeback, perform a chargeback>>.

=== Open Payment Details

To get to the Payment Details page:

. Open an account.
. Click *Payments* on the sub-menu.
. Select a payment number.

[NOTE]
*Note:* To see the associated payment method information, you may need to scroll down the page.

[[refund_a_payment]]
=== Refund a Payment

When you refund a payment from the Payment Details page, it brings the invoice amount to zero (i.e., the invoice will have no balance). You can also perform a partial refund in which the partial refund amount is added as an invoice line item.

The refund is applied to the same payment method used in the original payment.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You can also perform a refund directly on the payment method that was originally used. For more information, see <<apply_transaction_to_payment_method, Apply a Transaction to a Payment Method>>.

. <<Open Payment Details, Open the Payment Detail page>> for the payment.
