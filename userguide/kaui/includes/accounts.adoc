This section helps you become familiar with customer accounts and the layout of the Account page.

The Account page provides information about a specific customer, such as email address, physical address, and so forth. It is also the central location for the customer's billing information, subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods.

The next section explains how the Account page is laid out. To skip this and see the task-based steps, see <<create_an_account, Create an Account>>.

=== Account Page Layout

The Account page has the following sections:

1. Sub-menu
2. Account information
3. Billing info
4. Personal info
5. Payment methods

image::../assets/img/kaui/AccountPage_Labeled.png[width=850,align="center"]

*1. Account Sub-Menu*

The *Account* sub-menu organizes and provides access to different areas of the customer's account:

image::../assets/img/kaui/Account-Submenu.png[width=550,align="center"]

To see these areas, click the relevant item on the sub-menu. To return to the customer's Account page, click *Account* on the sub-menu.

*2. Account Information*

This section of the screen displays a summary of the customer's account information, such as their ID, currency, and time zone. To edit this information, click *Edit* next to Account Information.

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer account:

* <<edit_an_account, Edit an account>>
* <<link_to_parent_account, Link to a parent account>>
* <<attach_or_remove_a_tag, Attach a tag to an account>>

*3. Personal Information*

This section of the screen displays the customer's personal contact information (read only).

By default, Personal Information details are hidden for GDPR Compliance and customer privacy. To see the information, click *Show/Hide Content*.

To edit this information, see the <<edit_an_account, Edit an Account>> section.

*4. Billing Info* [[billing_info]]

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer:

* <<Pay All Unpaid Invoices, Pay all unpaid invoices>>
* <<Add Credit to an Account, Add a credit>>
* <<Create a Charge on an Account, Create a charge>>

You can also see a summary of billing information:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
^|Field ^|Description

|Account balance
|Amount of money due on the account, including any account credits.

|Account credit
|Amount of any money owed to the customer.

|Overdue status
|The status of the customer's account that indicates if they are overdue or up-to-date on their invoice payments.

*Note:* The account can have a negative account balance, but not be overdue. That's because overdue status depends on invoice due dates and how late payments are defined based on a company's business policy. For example, an invoice may not be overdue if a company allows a 15-day grace period (a.k.a. NET terms) to make a payment.

|Bill cycle day (BCD)
|The day of the month on which the system generates an invoice for this account. This field applies to accounts that are subscribed to monthly subscriptions (or a multiple of monthly, such as quarterly, annually, etc.). For more information, see the <<account_field_descriptions, Account Field Descriptions>> table.

|Next invoice date
|The date on which the system generates the customer's next invoice.

|===

The *Trigger invoice generation* feature lets you generate an invoice, either as a test or in a committed state.

*5. Payment Methods*

This section of the Account page lets you:

* <<add_payment_method, Add a payment method>>
* <<set_payment_method_as_default, Set a payment method as default>>
* <<delete_payment_method, Delete a payment method>>
* <<apply_transaction_to_payment_method, Apply a transaction to a payment method (authorize, charge, credit, etc.)>>

For more information on payment methods, see the <<payment_methods, Payment Methods>> chapter.

=== Account Field Descriptions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
^|Field ^|Description

|Name
|The customer's first and last name.

|First name length
|This field sets the length of the customer's first name. Kill Bill automatically calculates this number based on the location of the space between the first and last name. You can overwrite it with a different number, if necessary.

*Note:* This field is used if your organization needs to extract customers' first or last names for communication (invoices, emails, etc.). The field lets an organization accommodate variations of names used across the globe.

|External key
|An optional alternate ID for the account. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Tip:* The external key feature is helpful if you integrate Kill Bill with another system, such as a CRM, and want to use that system's ID in Kill Bill (for identification, searching, and so forth). Once this is set and saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

|Email
|The main email address to use for communicating with the customer.

|Bill cycle day (BCD)
|For monthly or quarterly subscriptions, what day of the month the invoice is created. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Note:* The system has three types of billing (date) alignment that affect the BCD: `ACCOUNT`, `SUBSCRIPTION`, and `BUNDLE`. For more information about the three billing alignment types, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/catalog-examples.html[_Catalog Examples_] and
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_billing_alignment_rules["Billing Alignment Rules"] in the __Subscription Guide__.

|Currency
|The currency that the customer uses to make purchases. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

|Timezone
|The time zone in which the customer resides. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

|Locale
|Indicates the language that Kaui uses to send communication to the customer (invoices, emails, etc.)  If your organization communicates with customers in a language that's different than the system's default language, it's important to select the appropriate locale for the customer. For more information, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html[internationalization overview] document.

[[link_to_parent_account]]
=== Link to Parent Account

When you link an account to a _parent_ account, the account becomes a _child_ account. Defining a parent-child association between accounts lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. For more information on this feature, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ha.html[_Hierarchical Accounts Tutorial_].

. As a preparation step, open the parent account and copy the account ID in the Account Information section.
. Open the account that will become the child account.
. In the Account Information section of the child account, click the plus sign icon image:../assets/img/kaui/i_PlusGreen.png[] next to the *Parent* field:

+
image::../assets/img/kaui/LinkToParentPopup.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Click in the *Parent account id* field and paste in the account ID that you copied in step 1.
. To set the parent as responsible for all payments associated with this account, check the *Is payment delegated to a parent?* box. If you do not check this box, the child account is responsible for its own payments.
+
. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the parent account ID as a link in the Account Information section.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Account-ParentID-Labeled.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
You can open the parent account by clicking the account ID link.

=== Add Credit to an Account

Issuing a credit in Kaui creates a credit memo. For accounting purposes, the memo is saved with the customer account's invoices.

. On the Account page, click *Add Credit* at the top of the Billing Info section.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/AddCredit-Labeled.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the *Add New Credit* screen:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/AddCreditPopup.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Fill in the fields:
+
* *Amount*—The amount of the credit.
* *Currency*—The currency defaults from the customer account and should not need to be changed.
* *Reason*—The reason is automatically selected based on https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html#_kaui_configuration[Kaui configuration settings]. However, you can make a different selection.
* *Comment*—The text you enter here displays on the <<timeline, Timeline>> page after saving the credit. Adding comments is optional.
+
. Click the *Save* button. To view the credit, select *Invoices* on the sub-menu.
+
On the Account page (in the Billing Info section), Kaui adjusts the account balance and account credit accordingly.

=== Create a Charge on an Account

Creating a charge in Kaui creates a new invoice. To create a charge:

. On the Account page, click *Create Charge* at the top of the Billing Info section.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/CreateCharge-Labeled.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the *Add New Charge* screen:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/AddNewChargePopup.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. To set the invoice as a draft instead of immediately committing it, uncheck the *Auto-commit* box.
. Fill in the fields:
+
* *Amount*—The amount of the charge.
* *Currency*—The currency defaults from the customer account and should not need to be changed.
* *Description* and *Comment*—What you type here displays on the customer's invoice. Both fields are optional.
+
. Click *Save* and Kaui generates an invoice.
. If you unchecked the *Auto-commit* box and have changed your mind, you can click the text *Commit* at the top of the page.
+
If you do not commit the invoice, it will stay in Draft mode. You can commit it by opening it from the Invoices page and clicking *Commit*.
+
On the Account page (in the Billing Info section), Kaui adjusts the account balance to reflect the amount of the charge.
