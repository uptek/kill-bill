This section helps you become familiar with the Invoices and Invoice Details pages.

For more information on invoices, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-invoicing["Invoicing"] section of the _Subscription Guide_.

=== Invoices Page

The Invoices page lists the invoices for the currently selected account. To open the Invoices page, open the account and select *Invoices* on the sub-menu.

Kill Bill generates invoices automatically based on the customer's subscriptions. However, you can manually create an invoice by <<Create a Charge on an Account, creating a charge>> on the customer's account.

Click the invoice number to open the Invoice Details page.

=== Invoice Details Page

The Invoice Details page displays information about the invoice, such as the date it was generated, amount, and so forth.

=== Write Off or Void an Invoice

This section explains how to write off an invoice and void an invoice. "Write-off" and "void" have different meanings in Kill Bill:

* *Write off:* Brings the balance of an unpaid invoice to $0. This method is typically used when closing an account with unpaid invoices (or when you are sure the invoice is uncollectible). When you write off an invoice, Kaui applies the `WRITTEN_OFF` tag to the invoice. For more information on system tags, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-tag["Tags"] section in the _Subscription Guide_.

* *Void:* Changes the invoice's status to VOID, in which case it is ignored by the system. An invoice _cannot_ be voided if:

** It was partially or fully paid.
** It contains positive credit items.
** The system internally adjusted any invoice item. (In this situation, you could refund the payment before voiding the invoice.)

==== Write Off an Invoice

To write off an invoice:

. <<Open Invoice Details, Open the Invoices Details page>> for the invoice.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice_Detail2.png[width=650,align="center"]
+
. Hover over the tag icon image:../assets/img/kaui/i_Tag.png[]. Kaui displays a drop-down:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice_WriteOffDropdown.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
. Select the *WRITTEN_OFF* checkbox and (optionally) type text in the *Comment* field.
. Click the *Update* button.
+
If the write-off is successful, Kaui displays "This invoice has been written off" at the top of the Invoice Detail.

==== Void an Invoice

To void an invoice:

. <<Open Invoice Details, Open the Invoices Details page>> for the invoice.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice_Detail3.png[width=650,align="center"]
+
. Hover over the trashcan icon image:../assets/img/kaui/i_trash.png[]. Kaui displays a drop-down:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice_VoidDropdown.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
. If desired, type text in the *Comment* field.
. Click the *Void* button.
+
If the void is successful, Kaui displays "This invoice has been voided" at the top of the Invoice Detail.

[[pay_all_unpaid_invoices]]
=== Pay All Unpaid Invoices

You can pay all unpaid invoices if a customer account has at least one outstanding invoice. Before you begin, make sure the customer has a valid payment method (see Note).

[NOTE]
*Note:* If the invoices have gone unpaid because of issues with the customer's payment method (for example, an expired credit card), make sure you <<Delete Payment Method, delete the old payment method>> and <<Add Payment Method, add  a new one>>.

To pay all invoices:

. Open the account on the Account page.
. In the *Billing Info* section, click *Pay all invoices*.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/PayAllInvoices.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
If the payments are completed, Kaui displays a success message at the top of the screen. To see the payment details, click *Payments* on the sub-menu.

[[generate_a_dry_run_invoice]]
=== Generate a Dry-Run Invoice

A dry-run invoice lets you see how a customer's invoice will look without actually committing it. This feature creates a draft invoice as if it's being generated on the customer's bill cycle day. It's a helpful feature for testing. (You cannot generate a dry-run invoice for an invoice generated from a charge.)

After you generate the invoice, which is in `DRAFT` mode, you have the choice to commit it. If you do not commit the `DRAFT` invoice, it remains in the system as a draft.

In order to generate a dry-run invoice, the customer account must be associated with a subscription that has a billing date in the future.

. Open the account on the Account page.
. In the *Billing Info* section, make sure the *Dry-run* checkbox is selected.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice-DryRunBox.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
. In the field next to *Dry-run*, enter the date that matches the invoice's upcoming invoice date.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Invoice-NextBillDate.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
. Click the magic wand button:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/i_InvoiceGen.png[align="center"]
+
Kaui generates and displays the draft invoice. A message at the top indicates it is a draft invoice.

[NOTE]
*Note:* To change the invoice from `DRAFT` to `COMMITTED`, click "trigger an invoice run" in the message at the top of the invoice.
