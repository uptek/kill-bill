=== Overview

Kaui lets you configure basic settings for how the system behaves when an account is overdue. For overdue configuration, you define:

* The various states that the account must go through
* The change in users' entitlements when the account is transitioned from one state to the other
* The period after which the state is re-evaluated

These three pieces of information make up the _overdue flow_.

Overdue configuration applies at the tenant level. However, you can also configure overdue flows for the _global_ Kill Bill system.

In Kaui, overdue configuration is a subset of the full overdue configuration settings. For more information on the full configuration settings and global settings, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/overdue.html[_Overdue System Guide_].
