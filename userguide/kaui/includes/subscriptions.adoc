[[pause-resume-subscriptions]]
=== Pause/Resume Subscriptions

Pausing and resuming happens at the subscription bundle level. In other words, pause/resume affects _all_ subscriptions and add-ons in the customer's account.

[NOTE]
*Note:* While a customer's subscription bundle is paused, you cannot add any new subscriptions or add-ons to the account.

You can use the pause/resume feature to:

* Stop a subscription bundle indefinitely
* Reactivate a paused subscription bundle
* Set a specific time period during which the bundle is paused and then automatically resumed

To pause or resume a subscription bundle, perform the following steps:

. Open the account and click *Subscriptions* on the sub-menu.
. Hover over the gift icon and click *Pause / Resume*:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Subscriptions-SelectPauseResume.png[width=350,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the Pause/Resume screen:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/Subscriptions-PauseResume.png[width=550,align="center"]
+
. Fill in the following fields:
+
* *Pause date*—The calendar date on which to temporarily stop the subscription bundle. To resume a paused subscription, leave this field blank.
+
* *Resume date*—The calendar date on which to remove the pause from the subscription(s). To set a pause to continue indefinitely, leave this field blank.
+
* *Comment*—The text you enter here displays on the <<timeline, Timeline>> page after saving the pause/resume. Adding comments is optional.
+
. Click the *Pause / Resume* button. Kaui displays a success message at the top of the screen.

=== Change a Subscription

For information on this topic, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_plan_change_timing["Plan Change Timing"] in the __Subscription Guide__.
+
* *Specify Policy*: You can select either `IMMEDIATE` or `END_OF_TERM`. For information on these two policies, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_subscription_alignment_rules["Subscription Alignment Rules"] in the __Subscription Guide__.

==== Cancellation Options

[cols="1,3"]
|===
^|Option ^|Description

| Cancel (default policy)
| Uses the default policy specified for the plan in the catalog.

| Cancel start of term (full credit)
| Cancels the subscription immediately and refunds whatever amounts have been paid toward the subscription.

| Cancel immediately (partial credit)
| Cancels the subscription immediately and applies a partial credit to the account based on how much of the service has been consumed.

| Cancel end of term (no credit)
| Cancels the subscription at the end of the billing period with no refund to the customer. Note that after using this option to cancel, you can still reinstate the customer (i.e., reverse the cancellation).

a| If you select this option, Kaui displays a pop-up from which to choose a date:

image::../assets/img/kaui/CancelSubGivenDate.png[width=350,align="center"]

*Use requested date for billing*: To set the entitlement date and billing date the same as the date you just selected, check this box.

Otherwise, if you leave the checkbox empty, the entitlement date is the same as you just selected BUT the billing date defaults to _immediate_.

|===

=== Update the Billing Cycle Day

Follow the steps below to update the billing cycle day (BCD) defined for a subscription. These steps assume the subscription is billed on a monthly basis.

If you update the BCD with these steps, the new BCD overrides what is specified in the billing alignment rules in the catalog.

[NOTE]
*Note:* These steps do not change the account billing cycle day specified in the <<billing_info, "Billing Info">> section on the Account page.

. Open the account and click *Subscriptions* on the sub-menu.
. In the *Actions* column (far right), click *Update BCD*.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/SelectUpdateBCD.png[width=200,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the Update Subscription BCD screen:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/UpdateSubscriptionBCD.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. In the *Billing Cycle Day* field, Kaui displays the currently defined BCD. Enter the number for the day of the month on which to bill.
. For this change to be effective immediately, leave the *Effective Date* field at its current setting. Otherwise, you can define a later date for this change to occur.
+
[NOTE]
*Note:* If *Effective Date* is the same as today's date, you will not see this change take place immediately.
+
. Click the *Save* button. On the Account page, the *Next Invoice Date* is adjusted to reflect the new BCD.
