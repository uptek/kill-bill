=== Overview

The Timeline displays a chronological list of events (that is, an audit log) that occurred for a specific customer account. You cannot make changes to the timeline.

To see the Timeline, open an account and click *Timeline* on the sub-menu:

On the Timeline page, you can:

* _Filter events_: Make selections in the *Filter by event type* or *Filter by bundle* fields to display only specific events (e.g., `PURCHASE`, `INVOICE`) and/or by a specific subscription bundle.
