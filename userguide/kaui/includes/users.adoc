=== Overview

In this guide, "users" refers to those who log in to Kaui to perform actions (add a charge, generate a dry-run invoice, etc.). However, other parts of the documentation also use the term "user" when referring to users of the API.

In order for Kaui users to be able to log in and perform tasks, you need to create a _user profile_ for each one. A user profile stores the username and password as well as the following:

* The user's roles (i.e., permissions in the system)
* The tenants the user can access

In this section, you'll learn how to manage users in Kaui, which includes:

* Creating user roles
* Creating and editing users
* Assigning roles and tenants to users

=== Before You Begin

Before you begin working with users, make sure that:

* You can log in as a Kaui admin.
OR
* You can log in as a user with the correct permissions for working with users, roles, and permissions.

In addition, you should already have at least one <<tenants, tenant>> set up in Kaui.

=== Additional Resources

For additional information on managing users, roles, and permissions in Kill Bill, see the following:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[Users, Roles, and Permissions Management]

* https://killbill.io/blog/multi-tenancy-authorization/[Multi-Tenancy and Authorization]

* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/security/Permission.java[List of user permissions]

==== Managing Users with a Third-Party System

If your organization uses a third-party system, such as LDAP, Okta, or Auth0, to manage Kill Bill users and roles, first configure them in that system, then add them in Kaui. For more information, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[Users, Roles, and Permissions Management].

In Kaui, all that's required is to add the username per the <<add_an_allowed_user_to_the_tenant, Add a User>> section, then <<edit_a_user, edit the user profile>> to define passwords and roles.

==== Managing Users with Kill Bill

If you are using the Kill Bill database to store user data, adding a user profile in Kaui automatically creates it in Kill Bill.

=== Create a User Role

The role (or roles) assigned to a user defines which tasks the user can perform in the system (for example, perform a chargeback or add a custom field).

To create a user role:

. Open the Add New Role Definition screen, either from the User Update screen (see <<edit_a_user, Edit a User>>) or by accessing \https://<your_host>/kaui/role_definitions/new.
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/AddNewRole.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Enter the *Role name* for the user. Do not use any spaces in the role name.
. Enter all the *Permissions* that are associated with this role. See the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/security/Permission.java[list of Kill Bill user permissions] as a reference.
. Click the *Save* button.

=== Open the User List

To open a list of Kaui users:

At the top of the screen, click the gears icon image:../assets/img/kaui/i_Gears.png[] and select *Users*.
