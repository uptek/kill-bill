=== Overview

Kill Bill supports the ability to generate emails and invoices in various languages as long as the required translation files are present in the system. Three tabs on the Tenant Configuration page enable you to upload these files:

* Invoice Template
* Invoice Translation
* Catalog Translation

The functionality of these tabs is very similar. To avoid repetition, we've included instructions  for just one tab, with any differences noted.
