=== Grids/Tables [[grids_tables]]
Grids (also referred to as _tables_) appear throughout Kaui to keep lists organized:

image::../assets/img/kaui/GridSample.png[align="center"]

For very large grids, use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

image::../assets/img/kaui/PaginationControls.png[80,500,align="center"]

[%unbreakable]
--
To sort columns on a grid, click the up/down arrow in that column's header:

--

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:
