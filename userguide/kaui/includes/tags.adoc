=== Overview

In Kaui, you can apply one or more tags to accounts and invoices, a tag being a single value. Tags in Kill Bill can be used to convey information about an object type. A tag can just provide information about an object (user tag) or it can actually affect how the object is handled in Kill Bill (control tag).

This section explains how to attach tags to accounts and invoices. It also describes the steps for creating the tag definitions on which a user tag is based.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You can use the API to attach tags to even more object types, such as payments and subscriptions. For more information, see the "Tags" section of the relevant object type section (for example, Payments) in the https://killbill.github.io/slate/[API Reference].

==== Types of Tags

Kill Bill has two types of tags:

* *Control tags*&#8212;Also referred to as _system tags_, these tags modify the behavior of the system. Kill Bill includes several control tags; see the API documentation for https://killbill.github.io/slate/#tag[a list].

* *User tags*&#8212;These tags are not interpreted by Kill Bill; they are a way for admins or third-party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Kill Bill does not include default user tags.

You can view all available tags on the <<view_all_tags, Tag Definitions page>>.

==== About Tag Definitions

In order to use a user tag in Kill Bill, you must first create its _tag definition_. As its name implies, a _tag definition_ defines information about a specific tag. In Kaui, you must create a tag definition for a user tag _before_ you can attach it to an account or invoice.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You cannot add, change, or delete the underlying tag definition for control tags.

=== Delete a Tag Definition

[WARNING]
*Warning:* Kaui does not ask you to confirm your deletion; use this feature with caution.
